    <title>What is Vuizvui?</title>
    <para>
      Vuizvui is a set of NixOS modules and machine configurations that aim to
      extend &nixos; in a way that fits the needs of the members of the
      &openlab; and also serves as a playground for experimental features that
      are yet to be included in the official NixOS project once they're well
      tested and matured enough.
    </para>

    <para>
      This means that module options in Vuizvui are subject to change without
      retaining backwards-compatibility for configurations outside of the
      defined machines.
    </para>

    <para>
      The name <literal>Vuizvui</literal> is of Bavarian origins and means
      something like <literal>too much</literal> while on the other side
      <literal>nix</literal> means nothing. Which fits quite well because this
      repository is for everything either too complex or not polished/generic
      enough to be pushed into &nixpkgs;.
