About Vuizvui
=============

This contains a [set of NixOS modules/configs][manual] and various other Nix
expressions used by OpenLab and its members.

The name "vuizvui" is of Bavarian origins and means something like "too much"
while on the other side "nix" means nothing. Which fits quite well because this
repository is for everything either too complex or not polished/generic enough
to be pushed into [nixpkgs].
