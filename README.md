About Vuizvui
=============

This is a [set of NixOS modules/configs][manual] which I use for my personal
machines, with a focus on patching most "dotfiles" directly into the packages
and thus using dotfiles only for experimenting/testing.

The name "vuizvui" is of Bavarian origins and means something like "too much"
while on the other side "nix" means nothing. Which fits quite well because this
repository is for everything I find either too complex or not polished/generic
enough to push into [nixpkgs].
